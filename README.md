## cool name here

This is my Culminating project for ICS! It is a 2d infinite-sidescrolling platformer,
with some cool mechanics and terrain generation! 

**Things to know for my teacher:**
- I use sorting and recursion for collision detection, in the EntityManager.kt file (in the entities subfolder)
- My user interaction is in the form of mouse and keyboard inputs, to actually play the game
- I use file input/output for storing highscores, in the resources/highscores/highscores.txt file
- I also use file input for storing the map, in resources/tilemaps/chunks.txt
